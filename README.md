This is a KNIME (Ver. 4.7.7) workflow created to share an IDS algorithm developed to use LSTM on a dataset generated on a CPS/ICS testbed.
The CPS/ICS dataset is the HAI Security Dataset Version 20.02 (https://github.com/icsdataset/hai)
The file HAI-LSTM-CODE-EPOCHS-10.knwf can be downloaded and executed using the file test1.csv, view the execution for the CSV Reader node on the code.
